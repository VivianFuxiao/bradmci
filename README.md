The library of tools created by Randy Buckner's lab (the Harvard Neuroinformatics Research Group) has helped to standardize and simplify functional connectivity analysis. This suite of functions customizes that work into processing streams suited for the Dickerson Lab, namely by freezing them to the well-understood, stable builds of Freesurfer version 5.3.0 and FSL version 5.0.1. To find generic documentation regarding the NRG library and setup, please visit [http://www.neuroinfo.org/w/public/wiki/Harvard_NRG_Tools the NRG wiki].
